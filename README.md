# DBot - A plugin-based Discord bot framework

DBot is a no-nonsense way to spin up a Discord bot with minimal effort. Simply [create a bot account](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html), copy your API key into [config.toml](/config_example.toml), and run `python main.py`.

## Getting Started

## Plugins
Plugins are how you add functionality to your bot. See [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) for more info.
